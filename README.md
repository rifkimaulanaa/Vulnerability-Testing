# We are not responsible for how someone uses this code. We have made the purpose of the code clear and it should not be used for malicious purposes. We have provided warnings and taken action to prevent users from using it for malicious purposes. If your web server has a vulnerability that can be discovered with our code, it is not our responsibility, but rather the responsibility of the person who uploaded and installed it.

While there are various versions of DVWA around, the only supported version is the latest source from the official GitHub repository. You can either clone it from the repo:
